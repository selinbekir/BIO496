HW2 includes basic introduction practices such as having an input from the user, simple if-elses and for loops.

HW3 includes functions, nested for loops, if-elses and usage of counters.

HW4 includes practices with dictionaries, nested lists, using functions.

HW5 includes parsing through 'ensembl_hg19.txt' file (a human genome dataset) to find transcripts with highest and lowest number of exons for each gene.

HW6 includes creating a Transcript Class, with Attributes of: Transcript ID, Gene ID, Chromosome, Strand and number of exons. Methods of: 5' UTR length, 3' UTR length, Transcript length (sum of exon lengths). Using 'ensembl_hg19.txt' file to create the instances of this class. And then, finding average transcript, 5' UTR, 3' UTR lengths and finding the transcripts with the longest 5'and 3' UTR lengths.

Finally, adding the method to construct the coding sequence using togoWS (that provides uniformed rest API for accessing major bioinformatics data resources and formats) API.

HW6_2 includes practices with regular expressions to find restriction sites of restriction enzymes.
